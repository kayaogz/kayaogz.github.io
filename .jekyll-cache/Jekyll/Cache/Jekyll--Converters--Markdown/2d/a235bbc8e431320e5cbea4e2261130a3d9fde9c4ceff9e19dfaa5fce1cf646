I"<p>Last April, after sustaining an inhumane effort of coding/testing/ debugging cycle for a couple of weeks, we managed to get some great speedup results for the first <em>communication optimal</em> parallelization of CP tensor factorization of sparse tensors, and submitted the first article of my PhD. thesis to the upcoming Supercomputing conference.
We got the wonderful news of the acceptence of our paper in June, which gave me the great apportunity to participate and present my work in one of the largest conferences in the field.</p>
