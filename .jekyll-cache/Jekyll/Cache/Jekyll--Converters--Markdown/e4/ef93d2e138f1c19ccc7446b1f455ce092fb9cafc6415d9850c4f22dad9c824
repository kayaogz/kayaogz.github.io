I"è<p>I have recently received the wonderful news that I have been granted the <strong>SIAM Travel Award</strong> for participating at the
<strong>SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (SIAM PP‚Äô16)</strong> in Paris, and presenting my work on
<strong>parallel sparse Tucker tensor decompositions</strong>. 
In addition, there will be numerous presentations involving parallelization issues in various problem domains, and I
will have the chance to attend some of these interesting talks. 
My talk will specifically be at the <strong>Salle des Theses</strong> on <strong>April 14, Thursday</strong> at <strong>2:40PM</strong>.</p>
