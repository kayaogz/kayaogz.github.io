I"l<p>I have recently received the wonderful news that I have been granted the <strong>SIAM Travel Award</strong> for participating at the
<strong>SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (SIAM PPâ€™16)</strong> in Paris, and presenting my work on
<strong>parallel sparse Tucker tensor decompositions</strong>. 
In addition, there will be numerous presentations involving parallelization issues in various problem domains, and I
will have the chance to attend some of these interesting talks. 
My talk will specifically be at the <strong>Salle des Theses</strong> on <strong>April 14, Thursday</strong> at <strong>2:40PM</strong>.</p>

<p>In the talk, I will present the parallelization of the <strong>Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI)</strong> algorithm which involves 
tensor-times-matrix multiply and truncated SVD steps.
Specifically, I will explain how to perform the expensive tensor-times-matrix multiply (TTM) operations in a
<strong>communication avoiding</strong> manner where we increase the total amount work in order to asymptotically reduce the
communication requirements.
Using this technique, our code graciously <strong>scales up to 4096 cores</strong> on an IBM BlueGene/Q machine using real-world tensors
having <strong>over 100M nonzeros</strong>, which enables us to perform Tucker analysis on such big tensors in the order of seconds.</p>
